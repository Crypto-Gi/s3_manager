# S3-Compatible Storage Manager

Python scripts to manage S3-compatible object storage buckets using boto3. Works with **Cloudflare R2**, **AWS S3**, **MinIO**, **DigitalOcean Spaces**, **Wasabi**, **Backblaze B2**, and any other S3-compatible storage service.

## Features

### 📤 Upload Script (`upload_to_r2.py`)
- **Incremental uploads**: Only uploads new files, skips existing ones
- **Recursive upload**: Uploads entire directory structure
- **Hierarchy preservation**: Maintains folder structure in the bucket
- **Content-type detection**: Automatically sets correct MIME types based on file extensions
- **Pre-scan analysis**: Shows what will be uploaded vs skipped before starting
- **Progress tracking**: Shows each file being uploaded with size and type
- **Memory efficient**: Uses ~30MB for 100K files, ~750MB for 5M files
- **Error handling**: Reports failures and continues with remaining files
- **Detailed statistics**: Shows uploaded count, skipped count, and sizes

### 🗑️ Delete Script (`delete_r2_bucket.py`)
- **Batch deletion**: Deletes up to 1000 objects per API call for efficiency
- **Pagination support**: Handles buckets with any number of objects
- **Prefix filtering**: Optional prefix filter using `R2_PREFIX` environment variable
- **Safety confirmation**: Requires explicit "yes" confirmation before deletion
- **Detailed logging**: Shows progress and reports any errors
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles API errors and reports failures

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install boto3 python-dotenv
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your S3-compatible storage credentials. You can use the provided `env.example` as a template:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your credentials:

```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_or_endpoint
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
R2_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
R2_PREFIX=
R2_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/your/source/directory
```

### S3-Compatible Service Configuration

The scripts work with any S3-compatible storage by modifying the endpoint URL in the code. Here's how to configure for different services:

#### Cloudflare R2
```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_access_key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret_key
```
Endpoint format: `https://{account_id}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`

**Getting R2 Credentials:**
1. Log in to Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to R2 → Overview
3. Create an API token with R2 read/write permissions
4. Copy your Account ID, Access Key ID, and Secret Access Key

#### AWS S3
```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=s3.amazonaws.com  # or s3.region.amazonaws.com
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
```
Endpoint format: `https://s3.amazonaws.com` or `https://s3.{region}.amazonaws.com`

#### MinIO
```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-minio-server.com:9000
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_minio_access_key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_minio_secret_key
```
Endpoint format: `https://your-minio-server.com:9000`

#### DigitalOcean Spaces
```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com  # or your region
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_spaces_access_key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_spaces_secret_key
```
Endpoint format: `https://{region}.digitaloceanspaces.com`

#### Wasabi
```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=s3.wasabisys.com  # or s3.region.wasabisys.com
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_wasabi_access_key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_wasabi_secret_key
```
Endpoint format: `https://s3.wasabisys.com` or `https://s3.{region}.wasabisys.com`

#### Backblaze B2
```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=s3.us-west-001.backblazeb2.com  # or your region
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_b2_key_id
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_b2_application_key
```
Endpoint format: `https://s3.{region}.backblazeb2.com`

### Custom Endpoint Configuration

To use a different S3-compatible service, modify the endpoint URL in both scripts:

**In `upload_to_r2.py` and `delete_r2_bucket.py`**, find this line:
```python
endpoint_url = f"https://{account_id}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
```

Replace it with your service's endpoint:
```python
# For AWS S3
endpoint_url = f"https://{account_id}"

# For MinIO
endpoint_url = f"https://{account_id}"

# For any custom endpoint
endpoint_url = "https://your-custom-s3-endpoint.com"
```

## Usage

### Upload Directory to S3-Compatible Storage

Upload all files from your source directory while maintaining the folder structure:

```bash
python3 upload_to_r2.py
```

Or use the helper script:

```bash
./run_upload.sh
```

**How it works:**
- Local path: `/Users/username/Downloads/source`
- Bucket structure: `bucket-name/source/folder1/file.txt`
- The source folder name is automatically included as the root folder in the bucket
- Only new files are uploaded; existing files are skipped (incremental upload)
- Shows pre-upload analysis with file counts and sizes

**Example workflow:**
1. Script scans the S3 bucket to get existing files
2. Script scans your local directory
3. Compares and shows what will be uploaded vs skipped
4. Asks for confirmation
5. Uploads only new files

### Delete All Objects from Bucket

Delete all objects from your S3-compatible bucket:

```bash
python3 delete_r2_bucket.py
```

Or use the helper script:

```bash
./run_delete.sh
```

⚠️ **Warning:** This permanently deletes all objects. Make sure you have backups if needed.

**Safety features:**
- Displays bucket name and prefix (if any) before deletion
- Requires explicit "yes" confirmation
- Shows progress for each deleted object
- Reports any errors encountered

## How It Works

### Upload Process

1. Reads configuration from `.env` file
2. **Scans R2 bucket** to get list of existing files (in-memory set)
3. **Scans local directory** to build list of files to process
4. **Compares** local vs remote and identifies new files
5. Shows analysis: how many files to upload vs skip
6. Uploads only new files with correct content-type
7. Reports detailed statistics (uploaded, skipped, sizes)

### Delete Process

1. Lists all objects in the bucket (with optional prefix filter)
2. Deletes objects in batches of up to 1000
3. Handles pagination automatically
4. Reports deleted objects and any errors

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | Yes | S3 endpoint hostname or account ID (e.g., `account.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`, `s3.amazonaws.com`, `minio.example.com`) |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Yes | S3 API access key ID |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Yes | S3 API secret access key |
| `R2_BUCKET` | Yes | Name of the S3 bucket |
| `R2_SOURCE_DIR` | Yes (upload) | Local directory path to upload |
| `R2_PREFIX` | No | Optional prefix to filter/organize objects |

**Note:** Despite the `R2_` prefix in variable names (for historical reasons), these work with any S3-compatible service.

## Compatibility

✅ **Tested with:**
- Cloudflare R2
- AWS S3
- MinIO
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Wasabi
- Backblaze B2

✅ **Should work with any S3-compatible storage** that supports:
- S3 API v2 (ListObjectsV2)
- Standard S3 authentication
- PutObject and DeleteObjects operations

## Performance & Scalability

### Memory Usage
- **100,000 files**: ~30 MB RAM
- **1,000,000 files**: ~150 MB RAM
- **5,000,000 files**: ~750 MB RAM

The in-memory comparison approach is efficient and works well even with millions of files on modern systems.

### Upload Speed
- Depends on your internet connection and file sizes
- Incremental uploads save significant time on subsequent runs
- Only new files are uploaded, skipping existing ones

### Batch Operations
- Delete operations handle up to 1000 objects per API call
- Automatic pagination for buckets with any number of objects

## Important Notes

- **Python 3.6+** required (uses f-strings)
- Use `python3` command (not `python`) if you have Python 2.x installed
- The upload script preserves the source folder name as the root in the bucket
- Content types are automatically detected based on file extensions
- Both scripts require explicit confirmation before executing
- Works with any S3-compatible storage service - just change the endpoint URL
- Variable names use `R2_` prefix for historical reasons, but work with any S3 service

## Use Cases

- **Backup and sync**: Incrementally backup local directories to cloud storage
- **Static site deployment**: Upload website files to S3/R2 for hosting
- **Data migration**: Transfer files between different S3-compatible services
- **Bulk operations**: Efficiently manage large numbers of files
- **Multi-cloud**: Use the same scripts across different cloud providers
